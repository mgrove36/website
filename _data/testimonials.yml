    I love running and flying -- fuelled by a successful career at Southampton University Air Squadron, and earlier as an RAF cadet. During this time I was awarded a highly selective flying scholarship, "Best Cadet" at the Royal International Air Tattoo, the position of Lord-Lieutenant's Cadet (an aide to the monarch's representative in Berkshire), and more. I also enjoy researching cyber security and further my knowledge in the field.

    I have historically volunteered with several organisations and societies, most recently as Vice President at Southampton University Cyber Security Society - organising weekly sessions and liaising with students, staff, and industry partners to ensure the success of the society. I am also a Cadet Force Adult Volunteer, providing me with extensive leadership experience: everything from pastoral care to planning camps.
